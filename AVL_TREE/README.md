AVL_TREE
========
This Programm is representing AVL tree implementation in java. <br>
This is done by inserting nodes in a Binary Search Tree fashion..<br> 
 and after every insertion checking for balancing of tree. <br>
      if not balanced then out of 4 cases(LL,LR,RR,RL), <br>
             one of the case is determined using wC variable..<br> 
             whose value is:: <br>
             wC=1 for LL;<br>
             wC=2 for RR;<br>
             wC=3 for LR;<br>
             wC=4 for RL;<br>
      and after that tree is balanced..<br>
