AVL_TREE
========
This Programm is representing AVL tree implementation in java. 
This is done by inserting nodes in a Binary Search Tree fashion.. 
 and after every insertion checking for balancing of tree. 
      if not balanced then out of 4 cases(LL,LR,RR,RL), 
             one of the case is determined using wC variable.. 
             whose value is:: 
             wC=1 for LL;
             wC=2 for RR;
             wC=3 for LR;
             wC=4 for RL;
      and after that tree is balanced..
